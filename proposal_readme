# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Easy Shopping

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that will have a grocery store in which you can ask for specific items to buy and it will tell you if the it is available or not. Then, the total wil of the items will be added.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will ask you you "the customer" what you would like to buy and you would name the item and if the grocery store has it would ask you how many items you want. Next, it will ask you if you want something else and if you do it will ask how many you want. If the item is not avaliable at the store it will tell you "sorry, the item is not avaliable, is there anything else you want?" Once you say there isn't anything else you want, the program will ask you if you are ready to check out. Once you respond yes it will add up the total of all items you want and give your final price.
